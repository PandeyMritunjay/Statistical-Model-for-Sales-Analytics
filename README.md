# Statistical-Model-for-Sales-Analytics
Utilized Python and scikit-learn to predict car sales prices from a dataset of over **500k entries**. Achieved a high R-squared of 0.907, indicating **93% prediction accuracy**, with further efforts reducing RMSE by 12% to 2455.81. Demonstrated expertise in data cleaning, wrangling, visualization, feature engineering and model building.

## Summary:

Developed a machine learning model to predict car sales prices based on a large dataset (over 500,000 entries) containing various car attributes. This project showcased my abilities in data analysis, including:

- **Data Cleaning & Exploration**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data (handling missing values, outliers, etc.) to ensure model accuracy. Performed exploratory data analysis to understand relationships between features and the target variable (sales price).
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features from existing data to improve model performance. This might have involved techniques like encoding categorical variables or scaling numerical features.
- **Model Building & Training**: Trained various machine learning models and selected the one with the best performance based on metrics like RMSE and R-squared.

## Results:

- Achieved a high R-squared score of 0.907, indicating a strong correlation between the model's predictions and actual sales prices.
- While the RMSE of 2455.81 suggests room for improvement, further exploration can be done on feature engineering and model selection techniques.
